Description of Project: Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard Using Excel
This project involved the creation of an interactive and comprehensive sales dashboard for a coffee shop, using Microsoft Excel to analyze and visualize retail sales data. The main objective of the project was to derive actionable insights from transaction data to enhance the performance of the coffee shop by making informed, data-driven decisions. The dashboard consolidates key sales metrics, enabling the coffee shop's management to monitor trends, track performance, and identify opportunities for improvement.

Project Overview:
The project is based on sales transaction data with the following key data fields:

Transaction ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
Transaction Date: The date the transaction took place.
Transaction Time: The exact time of the transaction.
Transaction Quantity: The quantity of items sold in each transaction.
Store ID: The identifier for the specific coffee shop location.
Store Location: The physical location of the store (e.g., neighborhood or city).
Product ID: Unique identifier for the product sold.
Unit Price: The price of a single unit of the product.
Product Category: The category of the product (e.g., coffee, tea, pastries).
Product Type: The specific type or variant of the product (e.g., espresso, cappuccino).
Product Detail: Detailed description of the product, including size or flavor options.
Methodology:
The dashboard was developed by first gathering and cleaning transaction data from the coffee shop’s sales logs. Key analyses were then conducted using Excel’s built-in functions, such as SUMIF, COUNTIF, and pivot tables, to aggregate and interpret the data. The data was also visualized using charts and graphs for better understanding and presentation. The dashboard allows for filtering by various dimensions (e.g., store location, date range, product category) to enable a dynamic and interactive experience for the user.

Recommended Analysis:
The primary goal of the dashboard was to answer several key business questions and provide insights into sales performance, including:

Sales Variation by Day of the Week and Hour of the Day:

Objective: To determine how sales vary on different days of the week and at different times of the day. This helps identify peak times for sales activity, which is critical for staffing and inventory planning.
Analysis: Using transaction date and time, the dashboard calculates total sales for each day of the week and hour of the day to spot trends and peak sales periods.
Total Sales Revenue for Each Month:

Objective: To calculate the total sales revenue for each month, providing a high-level view of the coffee shop's financial performance.
Analysis: Monthly sales are summarized by grouping transactions based on the transaction date and calculating total revenue by multiplying quantity sold with unit price.
Sales Variation Across Different Store Locations:

Objective: To assess how sales differ across the coffee shop’s various store locations, enabling the identification of top-performing stores.
Analysis: The dashboard uses store ID and store location data to compare sales performance across different locations, providing insights into regional sales performance.
Average Price per Order:

Objective: To calculate the average amount spent per order or transaction, offering insights into customer spending behavior.
Analysis: The average order value is calculated by dividing total sales revenue by the number of transactions over a specified period.
Best-Selling Products by Quantity and Revenue:

Objective: To identify the best-selling products in terms of quantity and total revenue, helping the coffee shop optimize inventory and marketing efforts.
Analysis: Using product ID and transaction quantity, the dashboard identifies top-selling products, and unit price is factored in to identify products with the highest revenue generation.
Sales Variation by Product Category and Type:

Objective: To analyze how sales perform across different product categories (e.g., coffee, tea, pastries) and product types (e.g., espresso, cappuccino), allowing for better decision-making in product offerings.
Analysis: Product categories and types are grouped, and total sales and quantities sold are calculated to provide insights into which product categories and types are most popular among customers.
Key Features:
Pivot Tables: Used for summarizing sales data by day, week, store location, and product type/category.
Data Visualization: Graphical representations of sales trends, peak times, and product performance, including bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts.
Interactive Filters: Slicers and drop-down menus for selecting specific time periods, store locations, and product categories for in-depth analysis.
KPI Tracking: The dashboard displays key performance indicators (KPIs) like total sales revenue, average price per order, and top-selling products.
Outcome and Benefits:
The coffee shop sales dashboard provides a clear, data-driven view of sales performance across multiple dimensions, such as time of day, location, and product category. By using this dashboard, the coffee shop owner or manager can:

Optimize inventory based on sales trends.
Plan staffing more effectively during peak hours.
Identify underperforming products and adjust marketing or menu offerings accordingly.
Make informed decisions about pricing and promotions based on detailed sales analysis.
Overall, the dashboard enables the coffee shop to enhance its operations, increase profitability, and deliver a better customer experience by responding quickly to changing sales patterns and trends.
